# DizzyBlog

Welcome to **DizzyBlog**, a dynamic and interactive blogging platform! ðŸš€

## Project Overview

**DizzyBlog** is a web application developed using modern technologies to provide a seamless blogging experience. Users can read posts, leave comments, and interact with content in real-time, with all data securely stored in a headless CMS.

## Key Features

- **Read and Comment**: Users can read blog posts and leave comments that are stored permanently.
- **Edit and Delete Comments**: Comments can be edited or deleted directly from the frontend, requiring only the user's email for identification.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Blog details are managed with dynamic routing for an optimized user experience.
- **Headless CMS Integration**: Data is stored and managed through **Sanity CMS** without the need for a traditional backend.
- **Modern Styling**: The UI is styled using **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for a fast, server-rendered React application.
- **CMS**: [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) as the headless CMS for data storage and management.
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for modern and responsive styling.

## Project Milestone

This project is part of **Quarter 2, Milestone 3** for academic purposes.

## How It Works

1. **Reading Posts**: Users can browse and read the available blog posts.
2. **Commenting**: Comments are stored in real-time via Sanity CMS, ensuring they remain saved permanently.
3. **Edit/Delete Comments**: Users can:
   - Edit or delete their comments by providing their email for verification (no complex authentication).
   - Use a temporary/random email if needed, as no password is required.
4. **Future Enhancements**:
   - The "Generate Blog" button will be activated post-hackathon, allowing users to create new blog posts.
